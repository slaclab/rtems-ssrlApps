THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN YET, SORRY!

Some useful information regarding 'configure' options
can be found in cexp/INSTALL.

Basic instructions:

 - make sure PATH contains toolchain directory
 - mkdir build
 - chdir build
 - ../configure --with-rtems-top=/afs/slac/package/rtems/<version> \
                --prefix=/afs/slac/package/rtems/<version>
 - make
 - make install

This builds ssrlApps for all architectures/BSPs which are installed
under --with-rtems-top. The list of BSPs can be explicitly defined
using --with-rtemsbsp='bsp1 bsp2 bsp3 ...'.

The default installation path for binaries, libraries and includes is

 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/bin
 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/lib
 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/include

but can be modified using the standard --exec-prefix, --libdir, --includedir
options (see 'configure' documentation and cexp/INSTALL).

Other useful options:

    --enable-std-rtems-installdirs
            Install directly into the RTEMS installation directories;
			by default a location *outside* of the standard location
			is used. If you don't use this option you can also fine-tune
			the installation using the usual --prefix, --exec-prefix,
			--libdir, --includedir etc. options. If you use this
			option '--prefix' & friends are effectively overridden.

	--with-hostbindir=<path>
			Where tools, i.e., programs that execute on the development
			platform are to be installed. Defaults to

			   PREFIX/host/${build_alias}/bin
